# Autonomous-Car
Using an Arduino I made an autonomous and tele op car. The autonomous mode is meant to be used in a prebuilt track whearas the tele op can be used anywhere.
Using motors and flex sensors I have the car able to drive itself without hitting any obstacles and running into things. 
Flex sensors are placed in front of the car to help it determine whether to turn left or right
I also have photoresistors placed on four sides of the car in order to allow the car to be manually controlled.
Each light corrosponds with a different movement such as move forward, turn left, turn right, and move backward.
